chrome-units
============

This is a simple Chrome extension that will convert kilograms and stones to pounds when you select the text you wish to convert.

It may be expanded to other unit types in the future.

Note that I deliberately did not have this extension perform a full scan on the entire webpage to find text to convert, since extensions that increase page load times in any way have a specially reserved spot for them in hell.
